# Qatium Sample plugin in Vanilla Typescript

This sample is a skeleton project of a Qatium plugin. Using it, you can extend Qatium's functionality and its user interface.

## Running the plugin

Start the development server
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open Qatium in development mode to see your changes. To do so, open Qatium and enter one of your networks. When it has finished loading, enable developer mode by adding `?developerMode=true` to the network URL, like the following:

From
```
https://qatium.app/network/ece7ed44-7d42-4193-b117-6a979c0c513f/Magnetic-Island,-AU-Demo
```

To
```
https://qatium.app/network/ece7ed44-7d42-4193-b117-6a979c0c513f/Magnetic-Island,-AU-Demo?developerMode=true
```

You should see your new plugin in the right side panel.
